      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I'm not sure what my dream job is</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in New Jersey. Though I just moved back here from Vancouver.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>My background is primarily in physical work, welding, painting, carpentry. I primarily focus on installation work and sculpture. What I've noticed is that with the limits of working with my hands my art sometimes lacks dimension that I think could be explored through alternative mediums. Web Development seems like a good step in exploring the world of coding and providing me with a new set of skills that can be used in a variety of ways both in the professional web development world and in the professional art world.</p>
